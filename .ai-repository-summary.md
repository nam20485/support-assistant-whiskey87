# Repository Summary: `support-assistant-whiskey87`

<overview>

This repository contains a C#/.NET Avalonia desktop application called SupportAssistant - a privacy-first Windows assistant that answers troubleshooting questions using an on-device LLM grounded by a curated local knowledge base (RAG). The repository includes complete planning docs, a working foundation with solution structure, and ongoing workflow implementation.

</overview>

<high_level_details>

- Primary languages: C# (.NET 9.0), PowerShell (`.ps1`), Markdown (`.md`)
- UI Framework: Avalonia UI with MVVM pattern
- AI/ML: Microsoft Phi-3-mini (ONNX) with ONNX Runtime + DirectML
- Database: SQLite with local RAG vector storage
- Node tooling: Node >= 22 is expected (local: Node v24.11.1); `package.json` is intentionally minimal for CI caching.
- GitHub automation: relies on `gh` CLI and GitHub Projects (v2).

</high_level_details>>

<build_and_validation>

- Build the solution:
  - `dotnet restore` (restore dependencies)
  - `dotnet build` (build all 7 projects successfully)
  - `dotnet run --project src/SupportAssistant.App` (run the application)

GitHub setup scripts (require `gh` auth):
- `./scripts/test-github-permissions.ps1 -Owner <github-user> [-AutoFixAuth]`
- `./scripts/import-labels.ps1 -Repo <owner/repo> -LabelsFile ./.labels.json`
- `./scripts/create-milestones.ps1 -Repo <owner/repo> -Titles "Phase 1: ...","Phase 2: ..."`
