# Repository Summary: `support-assistant-whiskey87`

<overview>

This repository is a starter/workflow workspace used to plan and bootstrap a new application. It currently contains planning docs, GitHub automation scripts, and workflow artifacts; it does not yet contain an implemented application.

</overview>

<high_level_details>

- Primary languages: PowerShell (`.ps1`) and Markdown (`.md`)
- Node tooling: Node >= 22 is expected (local: Node v24.11.1); `package.json` is intentionally minimal for CI caching.
- GitHub automation: relies on `gh` CLI and GitHub Projects (v2).

</high_level_details>

<build_and_validation>

- Quick local smoke check:
  - `npm run env:summary`

GitHub setup scripts (require `gh` auth):

- `./scripts/create-milestones.ps1 -Repo <owner/repo> -Titles "Phase 1: ...","Phase 2: ..."`
